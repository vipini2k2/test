Follow up by installing fail2ban :

# yum -y install fail2ban
Step: 2. Copy the Configuration File :

# cp /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf /etc/fail2ban/jail.local

"ignoreip" can be an IP address, a CIDR mask or a DNS host. Fail2ban will not
ban a host which matches an address in this list. Several addresses can be
defined using space separator.
ignoreip = 127.0.0.1/8  103.10.0.0/16
"bantime" is the number of seconds that a host is banned.
bantime = 3600
A host is banned if it has generated "maxretry" during the last "findtime"
seconds.
findtime = 1800
"maxretry" is the number of failures before a host get banned.
maxretry = 3

-- Save & Quit (:wq)

Step: 4. Restart Fail2Ban :
